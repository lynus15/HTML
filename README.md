Being trained in the use of computers since the junior level is something worth attending to more so considering its helpful advantages both academically and professionally. I am Lynus John Penaranda currently Studying at University of the East Caloocan, and I must say that the ability to use and understand technology is crucial in one’s success in almost all areas. Junior high’s computer education should ideally prepare students for future courses that revolve around coding, online communication, databases, and even solving logical questions.

Through the junior high students, especially those who are computer literate, acquire skills that will help them even in high school and later on in college where they will be able to learn more about website building, coding, and even AI, and cybersecurity among numerous topics. learners that take computer science courses earlier on get a head start over their peers more so in terms of academics achievements and subsequently in their professional lives while gaining appreciation of the ever encompassing digital world around them.
